# Speech-to-text-Text-to-speech-Task-1-

# In this project, I have done the first task which will record speech from the microphone and save it as .txt file. Then, will read .txt file and convert it to .mp3 file. 
# I used PyCharm IDE to implement this project.

# This repository contains five files:
1- task4_STT_TTS.zip => the project as zip folder.
2- transcribe.py => the python file which converts the speech to text.
3- TTS.py => the python file which converts the text to speech.
4- demofile.txt => the text file which contains the speech I have recorded as an example.
5- speech.mp3 => the audio file which plays the speech that is saved in the text file.

# The project flow:
First, I executed transcribe.py file using the terminal and recorded 'I want to evaluate' phrase.
Second, the phrase is saved in demofile.txt inside the same project package.
Third, I executed TTS.py file so it read 'I want to evaluate' phrase from the demofile.txt and convert it to audio.
Fouth, the audio is saved in speech.mp3 file inside the same project package.
